// 1. using // or /* */ for comment-line
// this is comment-line
/* this is multiple
comment-line */

// 2. learning var to assign a variable and end the code with semi-colon(;) i.e var $myName;
var myName;
myName = Budi

// 3. (CLEAN CODE) instead of var a; and then a = 9; we can do it as var a = 9;
var a = 9;

// 4. assigning string on the variable
var myFirstName = "Budi";
var myLastName = "Hartono";

// 5. Initialize the three variables a, b, and c with 5, 10, and "I am a" respectively so that they will not be undefined.
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = 'I am a';

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";

console.log(c);

// 6. Understanding Case Sensitivity in Variables
// Variable declarations
var StUdLyCapVaR;
var properCamelCase;
var TitleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
STUDLYCAPVAR = 10;
PRoperCAmelCAse = "A String";
tITLEcASEoVER = 9000;
// if you call it with console.log(TitleCaseOver) it still remain empty or (as 'undefined')
// instead do this

// Variable declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Variable assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;

// 7. Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords, var can be overide by the same var but let can only be one
var catName = "Oliver";
var catName = "omawo!";
console.log(catName)
// >>> 'omawo'
let catName2 = "Oliver";
let catName2 = "omawo!";
console.log(catName2)
// >>> SyntaxError: Identifier 'catName2' has already been declared

// the correct way
let catName = "Oliver";
let catSound = "Meow!";

// 8. Declare a Read-Only Variable with the const Keyword
/* Change the code so that all variables are declared using let or const.
Use let when you want the variable to change, and const when you want the variable to remain constant.
Also, rename variables declared with const to conform to common practices.
Do not change the strings assigned to the variables. */
const FCC = "freeCodeCamp"; // Change this line
let fact = "is cool!"; // Change this line
fact = "is awesome!";
console.log(FCC, fact); // Change this line
/* It is common for developers to use uppercase variable identifiers for immutable values 
and lowercase or camelCase for mutable values (objects and arrays). */

// 9. Add Two Numbers with JavaScript by using + sign between two numbers
const sum = 10 + 10;
// 10. substract Two Numbers with JavaScript by using - sign between two numbers
const difference = 45 - 33;
// 11. multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript by using * sign between two numbers
const product = 8 * 10;
// 12. devide Two Numbers with JavaScript by using / sign between two numbers
const quotient = 66 / 33;

// 13. Plus, minus, times, devide (+-*/) variable in one line
let a = 11;
let b = 9;
let c = 3;

// Only change code below this line
a-=6;
b-=15;
c-=1;
